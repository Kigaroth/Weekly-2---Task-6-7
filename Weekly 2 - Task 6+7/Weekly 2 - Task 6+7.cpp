/* Weekly 2 - Task 6+7.cpp
Make a program that asks the user what grade they want in Programming 1.
If the answer is A, write "Outstanding".
If the answer is B, write "Very good".
If the answer is C, write "Good".
If the answer is D, write "Some flaws".
If the answer is E, write "Not very good...".
If the answer is F, write "Fail".
If the answer is something else, write "That is not a grade!". (Use switch - case)
Update task 7 to accept both capital and lower case letters.Both 'A' and ‘a’, etc.are valid answers(use char as the variable type).
